Title: Create a Simple To-Do List RESTful API in Python

Objective: Develop a RESTful API for a basic to-do list application using FastAPI. The API should allow clients to create, read, update, and delete to-do items.

Requirements:

    Set up the development environment:
        Install Python 3.8 or higher
        Install FastAPI
        Install SqlAlchemy
        Install FastAPI-JWT-Auth

    Design the data models:
        User model: id, username, email, password, role
        Task model: id, title, description, due_date, status, user_id (foreign key)

    Create the API endpoints with appropriate authentication and authorization:
        User registration and login
        CRUD operations for users (accessible by admins only)
        CRUD operations for tasks (accessible by task owner and admins)

    Implement authentication using JWT:
        Secure API endpoints using JWT tokens
        Implement token refreshing functionality

    Write unit tests for the API endpoints to ensure correct functionality.
